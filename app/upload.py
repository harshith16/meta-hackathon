"""File/image upload endpoint.

Saves uploads locally (MEDIA_DIR, default ./media) and records them via
store.ingest_media. Images are embedded via caption/text only:
embeddinggemma v1 is text-only, so embedded=true appears only when a
vector was actually stored from caption/extracted text. Never claim
pixels were embedded.

Logs record ids and outcomes only — never file contents, tokens, or
message bodies.
